# Practice 1 - JavaScript and SQLite

Develop a JavaScript console application with Node.js that accesses the SQLite Northwind sample database.
The application implements the three SQL queries from last Friday as follows:

## 1. Reads all Finnish customers.

## 2. All employees from London.

## 3. The amount of Tofu sales.

When the application starts, ask the user which operation to perform, and then execute it. Display the results on the screen.
Which NPM packages do you need at minimum?
Bonus: Implement step 3 so that the user can enter the product name.
