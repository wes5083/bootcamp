# Practice 1. Simple HTTP API.

### Use your favorite programming language to develop a simple HTTP API that returns the following data in JSON format:

#### 1. A simple string ("Hello World")

#### 2. The current date and time

#### 3. An array/list of numbers.

### Once you have written the code, run the application and test it with for example Postman. How can you call an API endpoint with your testing tool?

### Tip: for C#, try "dotnet new webapi"
