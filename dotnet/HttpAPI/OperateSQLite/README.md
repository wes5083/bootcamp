# Pratice 2. HTTP APIs with databases.

### Continue the development of your API and connect the API with a database.

### For example, use the C# code from previous training days to access the Northwind database.

### Then, implement an API endpoint that can read (for example) Northwind customer data.

### Bonus: how could you implement a API endpoint that writes new customer information to the database?
