# Practice 1. ASP.NET and calculator.

### Part 1. Implement a single HTML page that contains two user interface (UI) elements: two text boxes (input fields) for number. Then, add a button to the UI that calculates the sum of the two number and displays it on the screen.

### Part 2. Create a new ASP.NET MVC application with the command "dotnet new mvc". Then, find out where your would modify the UI of the application (tip: look into views). Try to implement a similar UI for the calculator but by using ASP.NET UI possibilities.
