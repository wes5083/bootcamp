# Practice 1 - Python and web APIs

#### Part 1. Implement a Python console application that implements the "Guess the Number" game that we did in the previous training days. You can use the exactly same game logic as you developed it before.
#### Part 2. Implement the game logic as a Web API. Use the Python Flask framework for this. The web API should have two endpoints: one to randomize a new number, and another to check if a guess is correct.
#### For this to work, you need a way to store the correct number somewhere, since Web APIs and the HTTP protocol itself are stateless. What methods could you use to keep the state between API calls?
#### Bonus: implement an web user interface (with any technology you like) that calls the Python web API you developed in Part 2.
